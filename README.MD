## Executive summary
AI+Compassion brings together academics, technologists, cultural leaders and funders to build practical, human-centered solutions that scale responsibly. The aim is to move beyond abstract ethics to deployable pilots, community-centered research, and scalable programming that demonstrates compassionate AI in action.

## Mission, vision & guiding principles
**Mission.** Weave compassion into the fabric of AI development so systems amplify human dignity, equity and ecological flourishing.

**Vision.** A world where AI augments human potential while honoring cultural wisdom, social justice and the planet.

**Guiding principles.** Compassion-first design; cultural humility; participatory governance; practical impact; transparency & accountability; accessibility & inclusion.

## Areas of focus & flagship programs
**Areas of focus**
1. Knowledge — research, think tanks, interdisciplinary curricula and cross-cultural dialogues.
2. Leadership — training for leaders to steward compassionate AI initiatives.
3. Technology — emotionally-intelligent AI, humane UX and inclusive datasets.
4. Resources — funding, tools and infrastructure for practitioners and entrepreneurs (note: full sponsorship model is intentionally summarized elsewhere).

**Flagship programs**
- Global Forum & 24‑hour relay (regional hubs handing off around the world).
- Hackathons & co-creation sprints to prototype low-cost, high-impact solutions.
- Research & practice hub: open case studies, toolkits and shared code.
- Fellowship / accelerator to support early-stage social ventures.
- Monthly virtual gatherings for community-building and knowledge exchange.

## Governance, roles & network
**Organizational model (recommended)**
- Steering Committee — strategic direction and ethics oversight.
- Advisory Board — scholars, cultural leaders, industry figures.
- Program Leads — events, research, technology, fellowship, partnerships.
- Regional Producers — local organizers for each relay segment.
- Operational Team — communications, fundraising, logistics, legal.

**Network partners** (examples for outreach): academic institutions, standards bodies, cultural organizations, philanthropic funders, regional impact hubs.

## Events & convenings (operational plan)
**Event model**
- 24‑hour global relay with regional producers delivering 2–3 hour localized programs.
- Local hub responsibilities include venue, cultural programming, participant outreach, accessibility supports and streaming.

**Production checklist (high level)**
- Program brief, speaker kit, sponsor pack (summary), registration flow, AV & streaming, rehearsals, volunteer rosters, safety & inclusion plan.

**Accessibility**
Include closed captioning, language interpretation, sliding-scale tickets and accessibility accommodations.

## Communications, branding & assets
**Brand tone.** Compassionate, credible, culturally aware. Use existing visual assets (logo, gradients) on white backgrounds for clarity.

**Primary channels.** Website (www.aicompassion.world), email (ai@aicompassion.world), phone (+81 50-5539-0777), and social platforms for outreach and recordings.

**Content types.** Event pages, case studies, newsletters, research summaries, toolkits, videos and podcasts.

## Operations: policies, ethics & data stewardship
**Code of conduct.** Establish behavioural expectations, reporting mechanisms and enforcement processes for events and online communities.

**Ethics review.** Lightweight ethics screening for pilots; escalate higher-risk projects to an Ethics Advisory Board.

**Data stewardship.** Privacy-by-design, explicit consent, anonymization standards for shared datasets.

**Intellectual property.** Contributors retain IP by default; AI+Compassion requests non-exclusive rights for promotion and knowledge sharing unless negotiated otherwise.

## Monitoring, evaluation & impact metrics
Suggested KPIs:
- Community growth and regional activations.
- Program outputs: pilots, papers, open-source tools.
- Reach & engagement: attendees, streaming views, newsletter metrics.
- Impact metrics: deployments benefiting underserved populations and qualitative beneficiary feedback.

Collect baseline metrics for pilots and publish annual impact summaries.

## Implementation roadmap (rough idea)
Start by forming governance, launching a public website and community platform, and running 2–3 practical pilot projects in domains such as health, education, and livelihoods. Convene a Global Forum relay to surface partnerships and commitments while building an open resource library of case studies and toolkits. Launch a small fellowship/accelerator to support promising teams; use pilot results to attract multi-year funding. Prioritize community building, ethical oversight, and deployable pilots over rigid timelines.

## FAQs and common workflows
- **How to register and attend?** Registration flows and virtual access are typically listed on the event page; provide scholarship options for low-resource participants.
- **How to propose a session?** Submit proposals to the program leads with an outline and expected outcomes.
- **How to sponsor or partner?** Contact the operational team; sponsor benefits can be discussed case-by-case.
- **What makes this summit unique?** Interweaving cultural wisdom (e.g., Wa and Ma) with practical pilot work and a global relay format.
