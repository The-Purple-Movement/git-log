# People's Thoughts on AI + Compassion

---

**syan02** – Pretty good!  

**arjun_nair** – AI feels powerful, but only compassion makes it truly useful for people like us.  

**kahrunyeah** – I do think however much AI grows and can generate images in seconds or other artforms, it would never have emotions and feel that humans could give even though it's imperfect.  

**kartik_vyas** – If AI carries compassion, it can reduce loneliness in this fast world.  

**boredcosmicdeity** – The idea seems extremely relevant and well planned. The implementation is what I would like to see since I am curious about it.  

**atulraj85** – I love the idea of taking humanity beyond and reducing the information gap.  

**Gayathri** – Awesome explanation by Jibu Mathew, AI + Compassion is a great effort, and I would love to watch the execution and forward path.  

**psreyas09** – The issue of global warming is a serious issue and this is a nice solution to start to resolve this problem, so this is a good idea.  

**meena_subramaniam** – AI should not just automate, it should also acknowledge human dignity.  

**vivekanandan-ks** – Good explanations.  

**AjinkyaDahale** – naah  

**Parithikrishnan** – I think that is a good thing, and everyone should care about this.  

**Jay7221** – Would really help push forward in a better direction, a better tech more helpful for the society.  

**karanbhati24315** – I heard about this, and it's the best thing they are doing. I was expecting this to happen some day; it's best for our life.  

**ersascape** – AI is great when used with care, and with datasets that are legal to scrape. Otherwise, it's a big no :)  

**shornabho** – AI should be kept in check by the conglomerates pushing for the AI race, and regulatory bodies and thinktanks should come together to make it less of an arms race.  

**alviraruchbah_** – The idea is really nice. The thought of bringing revolution to education is really good. Wish to attend it too online.  

**avinash_mishra** – AI must learn to uplift the ignored, not just serve the privileged.  

**tanvi_dutta** – Compassion is what turns AI from a tool into a partner for humanity.
